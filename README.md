This is a WikiPedia WebApplication.
This is my first web app.

We had used Python with Django framework and simple html and css for building this project.

This wikipedia information is acessed with the help of wikipedia package. 
which is available for installation 
Use 'pip install wikipedia'

When we search a word using this webapp,it displays the information if its availale in the wiki.else it will display that 'its not available'
